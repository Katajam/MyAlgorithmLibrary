# My Algorithm Library
- This is the place where I put interesing and useful algorithms. 
- Most algorithms are tested by the test sets on HackerRank.

## Tree
### trie
All are in the chained dictionary version.
- trie.py
- trie_with_count.py
- trie_with_end_sign.py

### disjoint-set
Implemented in the array version.
- disjoint_set.py

--- 

## Graph
### Kruskal's algorithm
Use disjoint-set. A minimum spanning tree/greedy algorithm.
- kruskal.py

### breadth-first search
Has traversal and path algorithms for shortest reach.
- BFS.py

### Dijkstra's algorithm
- dijkstra.py

---

## Others
### prime
- prime.py
